  h1 Good:
  p - modeled after 
    <a href="https://imgur.com/TwlymMM" style="color: white">this</a> image.
  p - lots of practice with multiple types of shapes.
  p - happy with making mixins for buttons.
  h1 Bad:
  p - Took a long time for the 20+ shapes.
  p - Could have tuned the shading better to match image I referenced.
  p - I should have built new component for Mic instead of hacking button.
  h1 Ugly:
  p - the cross control is really ugly.
  p - left off the power icon, sleep label, and the slider button.
  p - ...and I don't play video game :(
