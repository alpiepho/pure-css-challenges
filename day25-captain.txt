Daily CSS Day25 - Captain America

A pure CSS challenge.  This uses HTML( with Pug),  CSS (with SCSS).  No Javascript.

Focus on clean and minimal code.

Good:
- had gone away from relative and %, but that seems to work better for centering circles
- completed in an hour
- able to leverage Pug triangle mixin

Bad:
- had to use points to resize/recenter star points instead of computing properly.
- could have used SCSS loop for points
- could have used ::before and ::after for red/white/red circles (circles 1-3)
- spacing of rings is not exact
