.learning
  h1 Good:
  p - Learned more things to do with gradients, like the buttons
  p - I like the shadow/mirror effect
  h1 Bad:
  p - Could spend more time tuning the look of the keys.

  h1 Ugly:
  p - Rings effect was an accident, don't completely understand it.
  p - And it makes the HTML/PUG messy
