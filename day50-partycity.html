  h1 Good:
  p - This particular challenge was easy...after doing the previous 49.
  p - Learned about text shadows this time.
  p - Glad I took this challenge. Took me 55 days :(
  p - This was a fun way to learn basic CSS techniques.
  p - Also an eye-opener to what is possible with complex CSS.
  p - Happy with my way to organize the HTML/Pug and CSS/SCSS.
  p - Clean code organization really helped do chnallenges quicker.
  p - Wonder if a prettifier plugin is out there (or write myself)
  
  p - Hope to take the SVG daily challenge soon.  CSS is hard, but I think SVG is more difficult.
  h1 Bad:
  p - Should have made changed dot on the i to a circle...but I know how to do it.
  p - Really didn't pay attention to non-Chrome browsers.
  h1 Ugly:
  p - I have estimated locations using trial/error.  Wish I would have figured out more accurate technique.
  p - I still struggle with units, when to use % vs hard coded px values.
