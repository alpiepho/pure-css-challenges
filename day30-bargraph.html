  h1 Good:
  p - very happy with how bar-graph mixin turned out
  p - very very happy with animations (overkill?)
  h1 Bad:
  p - this was fun, but will I ever use it?
  p - I should build a "shake" mixin/key-frame template
  h1 Ugly:
  p - the animation lists got a little complicated, can I concat lists?
  p - the animation @key-frames are ugly too
