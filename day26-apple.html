.learning
  h1 Good:
  p - from review of @kimdobie and here "what I learned" section, started "Good/Bad/Ugly"
  p - trying to add support for all browsers, such as for gradients (see .container)
  p - feel good about seeing how the pieces of the logo would translate to CSS
  h1 Bad:
  p - wish I would have started Good/Bad/Ugly sooner
  p - guessed at dimentions like border radius on container
  p - and time consuming/manual guessing of positions
  h1 Ugly:
  p - maybe I should build a prettyfier tool for Pug/SCSS style?
  p - ok, this took longer than expected...distracted learning new things
  p - really should have spent more time on bristles
